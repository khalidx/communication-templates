# communication-templates

A collection of templates for status pages, newsletters, and emails.

Open the [index.html](index.html) file in your browser, and fill out the
form to generate a static HTML file that you can open up in a browser or
email to someone.

## development

Running the `prepare.js` script generates an up-to-date `index.html` file
with all `templates/` embedded, for ease of use and distribution in
locked-down environments.
